# Backend Development Guide

Welcome to our backend development guide. This document provides an overview of our project structure, key technologies, and resources to help you get started.

## Technologies

- **Python**: A powerful, readable programming language. [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework. [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database designed for scalability and developer agility. [MongoDB Documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/)

## Project Structure (MVC)

Our project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, organized as follows:

- **Model** (`/models`): Defines the data structure. Interacts with the database.
- **View** (`/views`): Handles the presentation layer. Receives user input and displays data.
- **Controller** (`/controllers`): Contains business logic. Processes requests, interacts with models, and selects views to render.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your development environment**:

   - Ensure Python is installed. [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Install Flask: `pip install Flask`
   - Set up MongoDB. [Get Started with MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try)
2. **Explore the MVC pattern**:

   - Models: Understand how to define data models and interact with MongoDB.
   - Views: Learn to create endpoints with Flask to serve and receive data.
   - Controllers: Dive into processing data and handling business logic.
3. **Run the project**:

   - Navigate to the backend directory.
   - Run `flask run` to start the development server.

## Resources

- **Flask Quickstart**: [Flask Quickstart Guide](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/)
- **Python for Beginners**: [Python Getting Started](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/)
- **MongoDB Basics**: [MongoDB University](https://university.mongodb.com/)

## Notes for New Programmers

- **Experiment and Learn**: Don't be afraid to break things. It's part of the learning process.
- **Ask Questions**: No question is too basic. We're all here to learn and help each other.
- **Documentation is Your Friend**: Always refer to official documentation for in-depth understanding.

Happy coding!
